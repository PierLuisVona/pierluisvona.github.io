I hold a BA in **Design & Visual Communication** from the Politecnico di Torino and a **Digital Fabrication** Diploma from the FabAcademy.
My <a target="_blank" href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/24392201/TECHLAB-e-OCIAJ-Tesi-di-Laurea-Bachelor-Thesis">thesis</a> about the **Third Industrial Revolution** inspired the many fields I have been diving into my professional path: digital fabrication, educational technology, and 360Â° innovation.

I've been around **makerspaces** since 2012, working on a wide range of different projects.
I'm deeply interested in **media**:  I shoot both digital and analog, film, record and draw, working from pre to post-production.

If you'd like to know more about me, you can head over to my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pierluigi-vona-30415812b/">Linkedin</a> or download a copy of my <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZJDRFjQ2rDxFR29ERPVt4vxkA15ZGCFN" target="_blank">CV</a>.
