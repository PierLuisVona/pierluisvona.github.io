### Casa Jasmina
was a project in the business space of domestic electronic networking, better know as “the Internet of Things in the Home.”

Born in 2015 as a two-year pilot project, Casa Jasmina is still a showplace inside the large industrial building already shared by [Toolbox](http://www.toolboxoffice.it) Co-Working, [Fablab Torino](http://fablabtorino.org/) and [Officine Innesto](http://officine.cc/).

But now the background quest of my shooting,<br>
﻿*are there actually real people in Casa Jasmina?*
