# CRA - CARLO RATTI ASSOCIATI
is an international <b>design</b> and <b>innovation</b> studio based in Turin, Italy, with branches in New York and London. Drawing on Carlo Ratti‚Äôs research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the office is currently involved in many projects across the globe- embracing every scale of intervention - from furniture to urban planning.

<b>CRA</b> is the only design firm whose works have been featured twice in TIME Magazine‚Äôs <b>‚ÄúBest Inventions of the Year‚Äù</b> list, respectively with the Digital Water Pavilion in 2007, and the Copenhagen Wheel in 2014. In the last years, the office has also been involved in the launch of start-ups, including <b>Makr Shakr</b>, a company producing the world‚Äôs first robotic bar system, and <b>Superpedestrian</b>, the producer of the Copenhagen Wheel.

## STUDIO‚ÄôS GROUP PICTURE

While I was in charge of producing the <b>studio's group picture</b>, in late 2018, I met the 40+ people who daily work and contribute to creating the wealth of the CRA brand.

# BACKSTAGE
Shootings were produced during an intense studio day, spent at [Ugo Ricciardi's place](http://www.ugoricciardi.it/art/?keywords=affitto-sala-di-posa-torino) here in Turin, where we choose to bring just some [lift bits](https://www.opendotlab.it/portfolio-item/lift-bit/) as scenography.

I photographed together with [Edoardo](https://www.instagram.com/edoraw/), using some little lights, a huge limbo and two Canon system:

* canon 5d mk II - 24-70mm f2.8
* canon 5d mk I - 85mm f1.8

Than the great post-production work was made during the few weeks after, composing together various portrait and people in the final picture structure.

Cheers!
