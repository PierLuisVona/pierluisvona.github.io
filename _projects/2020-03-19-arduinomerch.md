Its time to show you some works Iâ€™ve done in **early 2020** for Arduino new merchandising launch.

New collectionâ€™s about *t-shirts*, *hoodies* and *hats* and the point is finally not to have picture of the goodies creased on the table.
The **concept** is actually to show how **lightweight** this stuff is, you can add it to your  chart in any moment to complete your order.

Seeing is believing!

The scene is VERY simple, **front view**, **full figure** and **plain background**.
Only with the addition of some balloons, the **clothes  float in the air**, and that's it!

## Here some shoots:

eheh and finally here its the __BACKSTAGE__:

The studio session was at [Toolbox](https://www.toolboxoffice.it) here in Turin, where Arduino headquarter is.
Shootings were done with some continuous light, remote controlled camera and a lot of fishing wire meters!
