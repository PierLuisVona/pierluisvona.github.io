<p>Iâ€™m a creative designer.<br />Iâ€™m currently looking for interesting <b>design thinking</b> job positions and <b>educational</b> cutting-edge <b>technology</b> projects.</p>

<p>I hold a BA in <strong>Design &amp; Visual Communication</strong> from the Politecnico di Torino and a <strong>Digital Fabrication</strong> Diploma from the FabAcademy.
My <a target="_blank" href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/24392201/TECHLAB-e-OCIAJ-Tesi-di-Laurea-Bachelor-Thesis">thesis</a> about the <strong>Third Industrial Revolution</strong> inspired the many fields I have been diving into my professional path: digital fabrication, educational technology, and 360Â° innovation.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been around <strong>makerspaces</strong> since 2012, working on a wide range of different projects.
Iâ€™m deeply interested in <strong>media</strong>:  I shoot both digital and analog, film, record and draw, working from pre to post-production.</p>
