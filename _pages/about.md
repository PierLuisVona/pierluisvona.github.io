Hi! Here it's Pier, <br> in this portfolio you can see photo shootings I'm proud of.

I'm a freelance designer currently standing on a various range of works, from <b>product design</b> and <b>photography</b> to <b>social innovation program</b>.

I always look for interesting <b>design thinking</b> job positions and <b>educational</b> cutting-edge <b>technology</b> projects.

I hold a BA in <b>Design & Visual Communication</b> from the Politecnico di Torino and a <b>Digital Fabrication</b> Diploma from the FabAcademy.
My <a target="_blank" href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/24392201/TECHLAB-e-OCIAJ-Tesi-di-Laurea-Bachelor-Thesis">thesis</a> about the Third Industrial Revolution inspired the many fields I have been diving into my professional path: digital fabrication, educational technology, and 360Â° innovation. Since 2012 I've been around <b>makerspaces</b>, working on a wide range of different projects.
I'm deeply interested in <b>media</b>:  I shoot both digital and analog, film, record and draw, working from pre to post-production.
