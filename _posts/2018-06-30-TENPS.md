The project stems from the need of the [LEVA.IO](/project/leva) guys who are looking for a new photographic identity for their **"strongest humans"** team.

Taking inspiration from some portraiture projects I decided to produce a device connected to the trigger of my camera that subjects the model to an electrical stimulation.

The result of the discharge generates above all **surprise** but also **pain, ecstasy** and **fear**.

The design is based on a **TENS circuit**: a medical device that involves passing low-voltage electrical current through the skin, in order to stimulate some specific nerve fibers.

The TENS turns on and transmits electrical impulses for **a second and a half** starting from the moment when you start taking the burst of portraits.

Communication takes place via two photo triggers, an arduino and a relay module.
