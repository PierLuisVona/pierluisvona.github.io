Ok, the idea may seem convoluted but it's actually *very simple*.<br>
I decided to modify a flash to shoot **graphics or watermarks directly in camera**.

To do this I decided to **mount a lens on the flash**, interposing an image between them.
I chose a flash, a lens and I measured them. To mount them together you need an adapter of course, but the most important thing I discovered is the **focal distance** at which to mount the graphics respect to the lens.

In fact, by keeping the graphics at the right distance, I can see it in **focus** on the projection surface that will be photographed.

So I started **sketching** the device, and then I **3d printed** it to assemble everything.
<br>By **lasercut** I produced plexiglass pieces on which to put the graphics to be projected and I fixed it at the correct distance.

Than in the end I assembled the **incamera flashing watermark device**.

## This is the final assembly, including the trigger for the flash and my compact camera.
