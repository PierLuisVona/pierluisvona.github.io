_**Filed under** Electronics, Educational kit_

This is a project we developed for a **network of high schools** looking for a tool to monitor some environmental variables in different classes.
We have based the kit on the **WEMOS**(ESP-32) board which, while reading a bunch of sensors, exposes an accessible wifi network.

The **webserver** shows the instantaneous and average data detected since the wemos was last powered on.

**Obviously,** we tried to document the project as much as possible in a [repo](https://github.com/techlabtl/KitMonitorScuola).

Small accessible customization to the students:
```html
//CUSTOMIZATION VARIABLES
//set the threshold of light on/off in lux
#define LIGHT_THRESHOLD 500
//checks sensors every x milliseconds
#define SENSOR_TIME 1*1000

//saves to SD every x milliseconds
#define SAVE_TIME_SMALL 10*60*1000
//saves to SD every x milliseconds
#define SAVE_TIME_MID 60*60*1000
//saves to SD every x milliseconds
#define SAVE_TIME_LONG 5*60*60*1000

//ssid name
const char *ssid = "Kit Monitoraggio";
```

that's it.
