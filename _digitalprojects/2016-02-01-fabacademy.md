In 2016 I attended the [FabAcademy](http://fabacademy.org/), a distributed educational model providing an educational experience about:
* website development tools;
* version control protocols;
* modeling with 2D and 3D software;
* laser cutting;
* design and programming circuit boards;
* interpret and implement programming protocols;
* interpret and implement networking protocols;
* the use of sensors and output devices;
* 3D printing and scanning;
* CNC machinning in small and large scale;
* mold design, construction and casting;
* mechanical and machine design;
* integration of techniques into a final project.

Fab Academy calls its methods *distribuited* because is runned in more than **70 Fab Labs**, for more than **250 students** per year becoming the largest campus of the world. Fab Academy Program is part of the [Academany](http://academany.org), the Academy of Almost Anything.

Over the course of the **25 weeks** I wrote various concepts designed some projects, which are about documented in my [fabacademy page](http://archive.fabacademy.org/fabacademy2016/fablabtorino/students/305/).

### and for instance?

Most interesting one was probably the machine design group project: [**the pluribot**](http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2016/fablabtorino/mtm.html).

The idea is to combine pixel art with bubble wrap. From the medieval cathedrals windows and the artistic movement of pointillism, to our dear and old digital pixel system, passing through the bubble wrap packaging!

> The Fab Academy is a fast paced, hands-on learning experience where students learn rapid-prototyping by planning and executing a new project each week, resulting in a personal portfolio of technical accomplishments.
