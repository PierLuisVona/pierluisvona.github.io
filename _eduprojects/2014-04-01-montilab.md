Montilab it's an initiative of "ALTERNANZA SCUOLA LAVORO" that was born at the Liceo Monti in April 2014.
The core is a series of afternoon workshops of participatory design and self-construction.
Conceived by Techlab and Liceo Monti to help students design and generate **furniture, services and communication** for their school :)

Up to now, **six editions** of the laboratory have been realized, with as many different themes and results but always with the same attitude of shared planning.

| Year    | Edition       |
|---------|---------------|
| 2014    | Book Crossing |
| 2015    | Green         |
| 2016    | Hackathon     |
| 2017    | Montessori    |
| 2018    | MontiCar      |
| 2019    | Monticiak     |

**Obviously,** everything that happened we tried to document it on the dedicated website:
