I've been taking care of the brand "Fablab for Kids":
a collection of **STEAM activities** bringing children closer to the **fablab technologies**, to the culture of **self-creation and DIY**, promoting an active and creative attitude towards **science and technology**.

While working at the project I managed the creation of products, courses, workshops and festivals involving 10k+ children aged 6 to 16.

Besides I've published the current version of f4k **website**:

Over years the project has essentially ranged between four subjects:

<h3>ROBOTICS</h3>
The robots are around us, every day. We learn to know them, to control them and even to build them.

<h3>ELECTRONICS</h3>
To hear and to visualize the electric flows, to harness them in copper circuits and to demonstrate to electricity those who command.

<h3>CODING</h3>
Knowing the coding is every day more and more essential. We try to teach you in a simple and fun way.

<h3>STORYTELLING</h3>
From the idea to its representation. We learn how to create 3D characters, video games and cartoons to shape our stories.
