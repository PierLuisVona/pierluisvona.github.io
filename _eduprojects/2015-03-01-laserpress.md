The [**laserpress workshop**](https://www.behance.net/gallery/24433755/LASERPRESS-Making-of-a-crosstechnology-workshop) was held during the [**PoliTO Design Workshop**](https://areeweb.polito.it/didattica/designworkshop/), from 2 to 6 march 2015 and was conducted by Gabriele Fumero, Davide Tomatis and Pierluigi Vona, representing [Archivio Tipografico](http://www.archiviotipografico.it/en-GB/) and TechLab. The workshop aimed at the reflection about the current state of technologic progress and the influence of digital technologies in everyday life, to imagine a possible future scenario, *either utopic or dystopic*. The proposed technique to express those reflections was the vector illustration, lasercutted on a plywood board to produce a letterpress plate.

The illustrations were then printed and binded to form a limited edition book.
The experimental technique used comes itself from a reflection about contemporary technologic possibilities and from the will to use and contaminate different technologies, not limiting to digital or analog technologies but referring to artisanship, be it traditional or contemporary.
