I hold a BA in **Design & Visual Communication** from the Politecnico in Turin and a **Digital Fabrication** Diploma from the FabAcademy.
I got graduated with a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/24392201/TECHLAB-e-OCIAJ-Tesi-di-Laurea-Bachelor-Thesis">thesis</a> about the **Third Industrial Revolution** wich I applied to the fields I specialized in the past few years: digital fabrication, educational technology and 360Â° innovation.

I've been in **makerspaces** since 2013, working on a wide range of different projects, always looking for what is really essential.
I'm deeply interested in **media**: I'm shooting both digital and analog, I'm filming, recording and drawing, working from pre to post-production. I can try to do anything that is googlable. I do believe the skypecalls are real life.

In conclusion, if you are looking for details about my studies or professional experience, you can head over to my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pierluigi-vona-30415812b/">Linkedin</a> or download my <a href="https://pierluisvona.github.io/pierluisvona.github.io/EN_PierluigiVona-CVResume-2018.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a>.

You can write me at **posta@pierluisvona.it** and than hold on, I'll answer soon. ðŸ¤ž
